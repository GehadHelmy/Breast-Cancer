    Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, affecting millions of women and some men. Early detection and awareness are key to improving outcomes.

    - **What is Breast Cancer?**: A disease where malignant cells form in breast tissues, often in the ducts or lobules.
    - **Prevalence**: In 2020, approximately 2.3 million women were diagnosed globally, with a 5-year survival rate of 90% when detected early.
    - **Types**: Includes Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC), Lobular Carcinoma, and rare forms like Inflammatory Breast Cancer.
    - **Risk Factors**: Age (over 40), family history, genetic mutations (BRCA1/BRCA2), hormonal factors, and lifestyle choices like smoking or excessive alcohol.
    - **Symptoms**: Lumps, changes in breast shape or size, skin dimpling, nipple discharge, or persistent pain.

    The app utilizes the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, a widely recognized dataset containing 569 samples with 30 features derived 
    from breast tissue images. We employ feature selection (RFE) to focus on the top 10 features, and use Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks 
    to analyze tumor characteristics. Visualizations are powered by Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear, professional data representation.
