# Breast Cancer Awareness App

A Streamlit-based web application designed to raise breast cancer awareness, promote early detection, and provide data-driven insights using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. Built by Gehad Helmy and Alaa Adel, this app combines machine learning with educational resources to empower users in understanding and managing breast cancer risks.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Visualizes tumor characteristics (e.g., radius, texture) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, with feature selection via RFE.
- **Tumor Classification**: Predicts benign/malignant tumors using trained SVM and Neural Network models (Scikit-learn), achieving high accuracy on selected features.
- **Educational Resources**: Offers evidence-based information on breast cancer types, prevention, and self-examination techniques.
- **Interactive UI**: Streamlit-powered interface with a pink-themed design, navigation for Home, Analysis, Prevention, Self-Check, Prediction, and About pages.
- **Responsive Design**: Custom CSS for a user-friendly experience, including motivational quotes and a fixed footer.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core language for data processing and model training.
- **Streamlit**: Web app framework for interactive UI.
- **Scikit-learn**: For RFE, SVM, and Neural Network models.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization (histograms, heatmaps, ROC curves).
- **Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset (569 samples, 30 features).

## Installation
